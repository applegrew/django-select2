Overview
--------

.. automodule:: django_select2
    :members:

Assumptions
-----------

* You have a Django project, possibly with models linked by foreign key fields,
* are using Python3,
* set up a virtual environment with ``python3 -m venv <location>``,
* activated the virtual environment,
* installed ``django`` using ``pip``,
* are already using Django forms,
* and your select lists are too long, or they look ugly to you.
       
Installation
------------

1. Install ``django_select2``::

        pip install django_select2

2. Add ``django_select2`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` in your project settings.

3. Add ``django_select`` to your ``urlconf``::

        path('select2/', include('django_select2.urls')),

   You can safely skip this one if you do not use any
   :class:`ModelWidgets <.django_select2.forms.ModelSelect2Mixin>`

Quick Start
-----------

Here is a quick example to get you started:

0. Follow the installation instructions above.

1. Replace native Django forms widgets with one of the several ``django_select2.form`` widgets.
   Start by importing them into your forms.py, right next to django own ones::

     from django import forms
     from django_select2 import forms as s2forms

   Then let's assume you have a model with a Choice, a ForeignKey, and a
   ManyToMany field, you would add this information to your Form Meta
   class::

        widgets = {
            'category': s2forms.Select2Widget,
            'author': s2forms.ModelSelect2Widget(model=auth.get_user_model(),
                                                 search_fields=['first_name', 'last_name']),
            'attending': s2forms.ModelSelect2MultipleWidget â€¦
        }

2. Add the CSS to the ``head`` of your Django template::

        {{ form.media.css }}

3. Add the JavaScript to the end of the ``body`` of your Django template::

        {{ form.media.js }}

4. Done - enjoy the wonders of Select2!

External Dependencies
---------------------

* jQuery version 2
    This is not included in the package since it is expected
    that in most scenarios this would already be available.

Example Application
-------------------
Please see ``tests/testapp`` application.
This application is used to manually test the functionalities of this package.
This also serves as a good example.
