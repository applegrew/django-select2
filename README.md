The app includes Select2 driven Django Widgets and Form Fields.

More details can be found on my blog at - [http://blog.applegrew.com/2012/08/django-select2/](http://blog.applegrew.com/2012/08/django-select2/).

External Dependencies
=====================

* Django - This is obvious.
* jQuery - This is not included in the package since it is expected that in most scenarios this would already be available.

Example Application
===================
Please checkout `testapp` application. This application is used to manually test the functionalities of this component. This also serves as a good example.

You need only django 1.4 or above to run that.

Changelog Summary
=================

### v2.0

Mostly major bug fixes in code and design. The changes were many, raising the possibility of backward incompatibilty. However, the backward incompatibilty would be subtle.
